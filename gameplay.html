      <h3>Pilots and Mobility</h3>
      <p>Pilots are highly trained soldiers equipped with advanced mobility tools, including double-jumping, wall-running, and grappling hooks. This agility allows them to navigate the battlefield vertically and horizontally in ways traditional shooters don't. Pilots can perform acrobatic maneuvers to flank enemies or escape dangerous situations. Their mobility is a core feature that defines the game’s unique combat style.</p>
